# You are given two integers A and B. You have to find the value of A^B. 
# Input:- A = 2 , B = 3 
# Output:- 8 
# Explaination:- For A=2 and B=3, the value of 2^3 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.

# a = int(input("enter a : "))
# b = int(input("enter b : "))
# for i in range(a,b):
#     power = a**b
# print(power)
